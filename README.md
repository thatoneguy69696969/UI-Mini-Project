# UiProject
 A basic game for students to add a UI to

## Overview
In this repo, you'll find a basic game where a player has to fight some monsters.
You can move the player with the arrow keys and attack with the enter key.
The player also has health, points, and lives. Enemies also have health.
However, none of that information is available to the player.

For this project, you need to build a UI or HUD that displays all 4 pieces of information.
You can display this information in whatever way you think is best.
